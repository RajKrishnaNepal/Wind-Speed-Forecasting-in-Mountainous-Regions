# Wind-Speed-Forecasting-in-Mountainous-Regions
We use machine learning models like Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), for predicting wind speed in four distinct regions of Nepal. The regions selected are: Gosaikunda, Kalinchowk, Simikot, and Solukhumbu.

The codes and data files have been organized by distinct regions. For each location, four different machine learning models (XGB, RF, KNN, and LSTM) have been trained and tested.
